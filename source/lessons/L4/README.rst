Lesson 4: Functions and modules
===============================

For the fourth lesson we will learn how to create and use functions, one
of the most useful concepts in programming. We will also introduce you
to the concept of library (referred often as a module in Python), which
you can think of as a toolbox for a specific purpose. Each library
contains specific functionalities (i.e., functions) that you can use for
different tasks. Thus functions and libraries are closely related
concepts.
