Using Classroom for Github
==========================

For the remaining exercises in the course we are using `Classroom for
GitHub <https://github.com/education/classroom>`__. Here, we'll give you
a sense of how Classroom for GitHub works and what you need to do to
accept your assignments.

Classroom for GitHub
--------------------

Classroom for GitHub is basically an application that helps you make
private copies of an assignment that you can modify and submit as your
answers for the exercises. We will create some template for an
assignment that normally would include the following:

-  A basic description of the assignment
-  A list of problems for you to solve/answer
-  Some "starter" Python code or codes that you need to modify for the
   assignment
-  Some data files to use with the Python scripts

For each exercise, We will post a link to the assignment (such as
``https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/a3e02d425c06db7948bcfe7ae78043``).

When you click the link, you will be taken to a web page where you can
accept the
assignment\ `1 <Note%20that%20the%20first%20time%20you%20accept%20an%20assignment%20you%20will%20need%20to%20authorize%20the%20application%20on%20Github.%20This%20will%20not%20work%20if%20you%20have%20not%20verified%20your%20email%20address%20for%20your%20Github%20account.%3Cbr/%3E>`__:

When you accept the assignment a copy of it will be made in your
personal GitHub
repositories\ `2 <A%20repository%20on%20Github%20is%20basically%20like%20a%20folder%20for%20a%20given%20assignment/project.>`__,
and you will be asked to make changes to the Python code and main
document for each assignment. More on that below.
