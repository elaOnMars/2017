Overview
========

The goal of the first half of the course is to introduce you to the
basic concepts of computer programming in the Python programming
language. We will start working toward that goal already this week with
our first taste of programming in Python. In order to start learning
Python, however, we need to be introduced to the course computing
environment, which is based on the principles of `cloud
computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing>`__. This first
tutorial will introduce you to the basic structure of our course
environment, guide you through how it is used, and conclude with a
hands-on introduction to some key concepts and elements of programming
in Python. The main components of this first lesson are below.

1. :doc:`Basic concepts, components and, workflow of the course environment <course-environment-components>`
2. :doc:`Introduction to the basic usage of the course environment <intro-to-course-environment>`
3. :doc:`Our first taste of Python <A-taste-of-Python>`
4. :doc:`Exercise 1: Creating a Github.com account and using the cloud <https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Exercise-1>`
