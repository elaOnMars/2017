Grading

General grading breakdown
-------------------------
Course grades will be given using the standard six-level grading scale from 0 to 5.
Your grade will be based on (1) weekly laboratory exercise summary write-ups, and (2) a course project (briefly described below).
The weight of each item is given below.

- 50% - Exercises (14 total)
- 50% - Final project report

.. note:: Deadlines for exercise write-ups and the term project are firm and given in the course schedule.
          Generally, exercises are due at the start of class the week following their assignment.
          If you anticipate you will not be able to submit any of these items by the given deadline, you should let me know as early as possible and must let me know at least one day in advance.
          Late write-ups will be marked down 25% per day late, so please submit it on time.
