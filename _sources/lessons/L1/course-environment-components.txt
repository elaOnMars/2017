Course environment
==================

Why do we need a "course environment"?
--------------------------------------

In this course we will be using cloud-hosted computers to learn to
program in Python and complete the course exercises. Of course, there
are many alternative options we could choose, including using your
personal computers, using computers in the university's computer
classrooms, or using `virtual machines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine>`__ on your
personal computers, where software allows your computer to run a second
operating system in a window. These are all fine options, but each have
problems we felt would either (a) interfere with your ability to focus
on learning Python, or (b) make it more difficult for you to have access
to computing when you need it. Thus, we've chosen to experiment. The
course environment described below is easy to use, but there are few
things that you need to understand before starting to use it. The good
news is that you can use the course environment with any computer at the
university or your own computer. All you need is a reasonably fast
internet connection, a web browser and some `remote desktop software <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software>`__,
which is freely available for any computer.

The course environment comprises three components that will be used
actively during the course:

1. `The Computing Dashboard <#computing-dashboard>`__
2. `A Computer Instance <#computer-instance>`__
3. `Git + GitHub <#git--github>`__

Computing Dashboard
-------------------

The computing dashboard is a web interface for managing computer
instances (described below). We will is use it frequently during the
course. From the dashboard you will launch a new computer instance
(i.e., start up a cloud computer) every time we are doing any
programming during the lectures or practicals. You will do all the work
in this course using such a computer instance.

Computer Instance
-----------------

A computer instance is basically a **temporary** computer running Ubuntu
Linux (tailored for this course) that you can use in a similar manner as
you would use your own computer. The difference is that the computer is
located in the 'cloud' i.e., it is physically located and runs in
somewhere else (on the servers of `CSC Finland <https://www.csc.fi/home>`__) and you can use it remotely from
any computer with an internet connection.

Git + GitHub
------------

One of the core components of this course (besides learning programming)
is to learn how to use `version control <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control>`__ with
`Git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`__ and storing your
the codes (privately) in `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__.

`Git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`__ is a version
control software (developped by a rather famous Finn named Linus
Torvalds - he also created Linux!) that is used to track and store
changes in your files (often source code for programs) without losing
the history of past changes. Files in Git are stored in a repository,
which you can simply think of as a directory containing files (or other
directories) related to a single 'project'. Git is widely used by
professionals to keep track of what theyâ€™ve done and to collaborate with
other people.

`GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ is a web based Git repository hosting
service and social network. It is the largest online storage space of
collaborative works that exists in the world. It is a place where you
can share your code openly to the entire world or alternatively only to
your collaborators working on the same project. GitHub provides a nice
web-interface to your files that is easy to use. It is a nice way for
exploring the codes and documentation or e.g., teaching materials such
as those in our course.

Both Git and GitHub provide many more features than the ones mentioned
here, but for now we are happy to understand the basic idea of what they
are.

Workflow
--------

The figure below illustrates the basic workflow that we will be using
throughout this course. We will be using actively all of the
aforementioned components, i.e., we will:

1. Connect to the Computing Dashboard
2. Launch a Computer Instance
3. Connect to our temporary remote computer instance
4. Download the course materials from GitHub
5. Save our work permanently to GitHub after every lecture or practical
   exercise

Page summary
------------

Now you should have (at least) a basic idea about the different
components of our course environment and what they mean. You don't need
to understand everything fully at this point as they will become clearer
when we start using the course environment.

Next, we'll introduce to you how the course environment is used.
