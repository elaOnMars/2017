Lesson 3: Control flow
======================

Control flow is the term used to refer to how the execution of different
parts of a computer program is determined. In this lesson we will look
at two main types of control flow concepts: (1) Loops, which are used to
repeat execution of parts of a program, and (2) conditional statements,
which use basic logical tests to determine which parts of a program will
be run.
