Basic vocabulary of Version Control
-----------------------------------

Few basic terms that are used often when discussing about version
control (not exhaustive).

-  **Repository** = a location where all the files for a particular
   project are stored, usually abbreviated to “repo.” Each project will
   have its own repo, which is usually located on a server and can be
   accessed by a unique URL (a link to GitHub page for example).

-  **Commit** = To commit is to write or merge the changes made in the
   working copy back to the repository. Whe you commit, you are
   basically taking a “snapshot” of your repository at that point in
   time, giving you a checkpoint to which you can reevaluate or restore
   your project to any previous state. The terms 'commit' or 'checkin'
   can also be used as nouns to describe the new revision that is
   created as a result of committing.

-  **Revision / version** = A revision or a version is any change in
   made in any form to a document(s).

-  **Clone** = Cloning means creating a repository containing the
   revisions from another repository. This is equivalent to pushing or
   pulling into an empty (newly initialized) repository. As a noun, two
   repositories can be said to be clones if they are kept synchronized,
   and contain the same revisions.

-  **Pull / push** = Copy revisions from one repository into another.
   Pull is initiated by the receiving repository, while push is
   initiated by the source. Fetch is sometimes used as a synonym for
   pull, or to mean a pull followed by an update.

-  **Merge** = A merge or integration is an operation in which two sets
   of changes are applied to a file or set of files.
